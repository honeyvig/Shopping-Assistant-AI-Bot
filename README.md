# Shopping-Assistant-AI-Bot
We are seeking a skilled developer to create a shopping assistant AI bot aimed at enhancing the online shopping experience. The bot should be capable of handling user inquiries, providing product recommendations, and assisting with checkout processes. The ideal candidate should have experience in natural language processing, machine learning, and chatbot development. If you are passionate about AI and e-commerce, we would love to collaborate with you on this innovative project.
------------------------
To build a shopping assistant AI bot for an e-commerce platform, you will need to combine several key components: natural language processing (NLP) to understand user input, machine learning for product recommendations, and chatbot integration to interact with users. Below is a Python code outline using popular libraries like spaCy for NLP, scikit-learn for recommendation algorithms, and Flask for creating the chatbot API.

This example will cover a basic structure, focusing on handling user inquiries, providing recommendations, and assisting with checkout.
1. Install Required Libraries

You'll need to install the following Python libraries:

pip install flask spacy sklearn pandas numpy

You will also need to download the spaCy language model (English in this case):

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

2. Define the Core Functionality of the Bot

We'll start by building a simple Flask app with endpoints for product recommendations and checkout assistance.

import spacy
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the spaCy NLP model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Sample product data (you would ideally load this from a database or an external file)
products = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Laptop", "category": "Electronics", "price": 1200},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Smartphone", "category": "Electronics", "price": 800},
    {"id": 3, "name": "Shirt", "category": "Apparel", "price": 25},
    {"id": 4, "name": "Headphones", "category": "Electronics", "price": 200},
    {"id": 5, "name": "Sneakers", "category": "Footwear", "price": 60},
    # More products...
]

# Create a DataFrame for easy manipulation
df = pd.DataFrame(products)

# Set up a simple content-based recommendation model using product categories
# In a real scenario, you'd likely use more sophisticated models such as collaborative filtering or neural networks.
category_to_products = df.groupby('category').apply(lambda x: x['id'].tolist()).to_dict()

# Initialize Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def handle_query():
    """
    Handle user queries for product recommendations or checkout assistance.
    """
    user_input = request.json.get('query', '')
    doc = nlp(user_input)

    # Basic intent detection based on keywords (can be expanded with more sophisticated NLP)
    if any(token.lemma_ in ['buy', 'purchase', 'order'] for token in doc):
        # Simulate a product recommendation process based on category or keywords in the user's query
        recommended_products = recommend_products(user_input)
        return jsonify({
            "response": "Here are some products I recommend:",
            "products": recommended_products
        })
    elif any(token.lemma_ in ['checkout', 'pay', 'order'] for token in doc):
        # Simulate checkout assistance
        return jsonify({
            "response": "Proceeding to checkout. Please review your cart."
        })
    else:
        return jsonify({
            "response": "I'm not sure how to help with that. Could you clarify?"
        })

def recommend_products(user_input):
    """
    A simple recommendation function based on keywords from the user input.
    """
    # Here, we'll just return some products based on their category
    doc = nlp(user_input)
    categories_mentioned = [token.text.lower() for token in doc if token.pos_ == 'NOUN']
    
    # Simple recommendation logic: Return products from a category mentioned by the user
    recommended = []
    for category in categories_mentioned:
        if category in category_to_products:
            recommended.extend(category_to_products[category])
    
    recommended_products = df[df['id'].isin(recommended)]
    return recommended_products[['name', 'category', 'price']].to_dict(orient='records')

@app.route('/checkout', methods=['POST'])
def checkout():
    """
    Handle checkout process.
    """
    cart_items = request.json.get('cart', [])
    total_price = sum(item['price'] for item in cart_items)

    return jsonify({
        "response": f"Your total is ${total_price}. Proceeding with payment.",
        "cart_summary": cart_items
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of Code:

    Flask: The app runs on Flask, with endpoints for handling user queries (/ask) and checkout (/checkout).
    spaCy NLP: We use spaCy to process the user input and detect intent based on keywords. In this example, we detect simple actions like "buy", "purchase", or "order".
    Product Recommendations: Based on simple keyword matching, the bot recommends products by category (this is a very basic recommendation engine; you could replace this with a more sophisticated model like collaborative filtering, neural networks, or other algorithms).
    Checkout: We simulate a simple checkout where the bot calculates the total price of items in the cart.

3. Running the Bot

Once the above code is in place, you can run the bot with:

python shopping_assistant.py

The bot will now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You can interact with it by sending JSON POST requests.
4. Sample JSON Requests

Here are example requests you could make using a tool like Postman or curl:
Query Example (for product recommendation):

{
  "query": "I want to buy a smartphone"
}

Response Example:

{
  "response": "Here are some products I recommend:",
  "products": [
    {"name": "Smartphone", "category": "Electronics", "price": 800}
  ]
}

Cart Checkout Example:

{
  "cart": [
    {"name": "Laptop", "price": 1200},
    {"name": "Headphones", "price": 200}
  ]
}

Response Example (for checkout):

{
  "response": "Your total is $1400. Proceeding with payment.",
  "cart_summary": [
    {"name": "Laptop", "price": 1200},
    {"name": "Headphones", "price": 200}
  ]
}

Next Steps:

    Product Database: Integrate with a real product database or API (e.g., an e-commerce platform's database) to dynamically load and update products.
    Advanced NLP: Enhance the natural language understanding using more advanced models or custom-trained intent recognition.
    Machine Learning for Recommendations: Implement collaborative filtering or content-based filtering using user preferences or past behavior.
    Authentication and Cart Management: Integrate with user accounts to maintain persistent shopping carts, order histories, and payment gateways.

This setup is just a starting point, and you can expand and refine it based on the requirements of your project.
